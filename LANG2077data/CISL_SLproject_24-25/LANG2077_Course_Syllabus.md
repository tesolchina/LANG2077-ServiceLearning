These case studies illustrate how customized chatbots can address specific community challenges, providing inspiration and practical insights for students’ own projects. The case studies will be introduced after the Community Needs Assessment stage, serving as examples of how needs-based design can be translated into effective chatbot solutions.  <br><br>Empowering Communities through Customized Chatbots: Case Studies <br><br>Case Study 1: Developing a customized chatbot to design course materials for a rural primary school where teachers are not well-trained on STEM subjects. The chatbot can generate materials that adapt to the local context but also take into account the latest high-quality STEM teaching materials from abroad. This chatbot can help bridge the educational gap and provide students with access to high-quality learning materials. <br><br>Case Study 2: Building a customized chatbot to support a mobile family community in Shenzhen, where parents struggle to understand the school admission policies of the municipal government. Under the supervision of experienced social workers and trained volunteers, the chatbot can provide accurate and timely information, answering questions and addressing concerns about school admission policies. This chatbot can empower parents and help them navigate the complex education system, ultimately benefiting their children’s education and future opportunities. <br><br>Part 3: Implementation and Evaluation <br><br>Chatbot Deployment: Guidance on the finalization and launch of customized chatbot prototypes within community settings, driven by prompt engineering and other human-AI communication strategies, including: <br><br>- Crafting effective prompts to elicit desired responses from AI systems <br>    <br><br>- Designing conversational flows that facilitate effective human-AI interaction <br>    <br><br>- Utilizing feedback mechanisms to refine chatbot performance and adapt to chatbot users’ needs including student developers and end users  <br>    <br><br>- Impact Assessment: Methods for gathering and analyzing feedback on the chatbot’s effectiveness in achieving learning outcomes, including the enhancement of linguistic and communicative skills for students and the communities they serve. <br>    <br><br>Dissemination and Celebration: Techniques for sharing success stories and the impact of chatbot solutions through compelling storytelling, highlighting the role of language and communication in effective human-AI interactions.|
