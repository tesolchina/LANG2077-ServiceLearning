Dear Dr. Li,

I need your urgent assistance with the LC Study Tour reimbursement process. The Finance Office has provided feedback requiring:

1. Your approval on declaration letters for scan copy receipts
2. Oracle expense report submission with you as approver
3. Potential TKP account extension (closes 31 Aug 2025)

Total reimbursement: HK$148,672.23

Could we schedule a brief meeting to discuss the approval process and timeline?

Thank you for your support.

Simon Wang
